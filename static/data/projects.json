			"description": "<p>This was the first project as a computer scientist undergraduate student at Hogeschool Rotterdam. As software engineers, we needed to learn how to cooperate on projects using the agile/scrum method. This project was meant to teach exactly that.</p>\n<p>For this project you had to design a real life boardgame (so no software yet!) with materials of your own choice. The project was divided in three sprints of 1 week each. The goal of this project was not to build a fully functional boardgame, but to divide roles and cooperate using the scrum method. The grade was partially dependant on the end product, due to the use-cases that were defined by a product owner.</p>"
